There is nothing to be gained from building gcc natively but
you are more than welcome to do so.  I haven't (yet) tried
doing it but there should be absolutely no reason why it 
shouldn't.  Other than:

[a] You require Debian stuff to install the gcc patches into the
    source.  If you install & setup scratchbox according to my
    instructions (armedslack-current/source/scratchbox/SETUP_SCRATCHBOX.txt)
    then you will have installed the Debian devkit which will 
    allow you to run gcc.SlackBuild without modification.

[b] You MUST use qemu - building using sbrsh does not work because
    gcc puts lots of temporary stuff in /tmp which isn't exported
    to the remote machine.  You could NFS mount the remote machine's
    /tmp but that didn't work for me either. 
    This was a while ago so it may work now, but it is infinitley 
    easier *and* faster to build under qemu.

[c] You need working ARM Linux kernel headers in 
    /usr/include/{linux,asm,asm-generic}
    /usr/include/asm-arm should be symlinked to /usr/include/asm
    (or the other way around -- that's just my preference)
