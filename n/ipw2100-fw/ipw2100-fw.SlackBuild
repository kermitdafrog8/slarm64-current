# This file is in danger of being copied over if we don't give it a

mv $PKG/lib/firmware/LICENSE $PKG/lib/firmware/LICENSE.ipw2100-fw-${VERSION}

# Add a documentation directory:

# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

# Apply generic Slackware packaging policies:
cd $PKG
slackstripall   # strip all .a archives and all ELFs
slackgzpages -i # compress man & info pages and delete usr/info/dir
slackslack      # chown -R root:root, chmod -R og-w, slackchown, slack644docs
slackdesc       # install slack-desc and doinst.sh
slackmp         # run makepkg -l y -c n

# Perform any final checks on the package:
cd $PKG
slackhlinks     # search for any hard links
