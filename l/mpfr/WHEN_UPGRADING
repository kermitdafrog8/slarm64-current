When upgrading to a major release, you need to keep the old version
of mpfr in place in ordre for gcc to continue working.

First build the new mpfr package;
 installpkg new_version

Keeping the old version on the filesystem too - just ensure that
the pkgconfig version is the NEW version.
Then it can be upgradepkg'd (or have the system reinstalled, preferably)
