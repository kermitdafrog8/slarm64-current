# If necessary, start the fakeroot server so we can set file/dir ownerships:

# Apply generic Slackware packaging policies:
cd $PKG
slackstripall   # strip all .a archives and all ELFs
slackgzpages -i # compress man & info pages and delete usr/info/dir
slackslack      # set standard Slackware file/dir permissions and ownerships
slackdesc       # install slack-desc and doinst.sh
slackmp         # run makepkg -l y -c n

# Perform any final checks on the package:
cd $PKG
slackhlinks     # search for any hard links
