# Package metadata:
export PKGNAM=gamin
export VERSION=0.1.10
export BUILD=1
export PKGSERIES=l
export SLACKPACKAGE=$PKGNAM-$VERSION-$ARCH-$BUILD.txz

# Reset the ARM file system: restore it to the 'factory settings'
# as it were (this has no effect when building natively):
sboxsysrestore

# Ensure base ARM packages are installed first:
slackbasedeps

# Ensure $PKGNAM isn't already installed:
slackfailpkgdeps $PKGNAM || removepkg $PKGNAM

# Ensure specific build dependencies (mainly libraries):
{ slackcheckpkgdeps glib2 || installpkg $PKGSTORE/l/glib2-*.t?z || exit 99 ; }

# Launch the package build script:
BUILDLOG=$( basename $SLACKPACKAGE .t?z ).build.log
( ./$PKGNAM.SlackBuild ) >& /dev/stdout | tee $BUILDLOG

# Compress the build log:
bzip2 -9fvz $BUILDLOG
