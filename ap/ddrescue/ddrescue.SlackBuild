# Apply generic Slackware packaging policies:
cd $PKG
slackstripall   # strip all .a archives and all ELFs
slackgzpages -i # compress man & info pages and delete usr/info/dir
slackslack      # chown -R root:root, chmod -R og-w, slackchown, slack644docs
slackdesc       # install slack-desc and doinst.sh
slackmp         # run makepkg -l y -c n

# Perform any final checks on the package:
cd $PKG
slackhlinks     # search for any hard links
