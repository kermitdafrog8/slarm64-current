# now included in x86 tree:
#sed -i.cmakehack -e "s|^cmake_minimum_required|#cmake_minimum_required|" CMakeLists.txt

# This did not work but the above does:
#( cd po
#find . -type f -name CMakeLists.txt | while read file; do
#  cat << EOF > $file
#cmake_policy(SET CMP0013 OLD)
#cmake_policy(SET CMP0002 OLD)
#$( cat $file )
